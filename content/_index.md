I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Mathematics](https://math.washington.edu) at the University of Washington, supported by the NSF GRFP. Broadly speaking, my interests are in differential geometry; my prior research has been in symplectic geometry and the spectral theory of operators. 

Currently, I'm working on an exposition of the Cheeger-Gromoll splitting theorem under the guidance of Gabriel Paternain, and I am co-organizing the Graduate Student Differential Geometry Seminar. I have also been spending some time learning Lean recently.
