I am a fourth-year undergraduate student in mathematics at Kansas State University. Broadly speaking, my interests lie in differential geometry and analysis; more specifically my research has been in symplectic geometry and the spectral theory of operators.

I am currently working with [Dr. Lino Amorim](https://www.math.ksu.edu/~lamorim/) on a project studying an analogue to stringy cohomology on dihedral twisted sectors. My prior work was at the 2022 REU in Mathematical Analysis at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, where my cohort studied the weak convergence of the spectral shift operator between two resolvent-comparable Schr√∂dinger operators under the guidance of [Dr. Roger Nichols](https://sites.google.com/mocs.utc.edu/rogernicholshomepage/home).
