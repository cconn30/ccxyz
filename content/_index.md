I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Mathematics](https://math.washington.edu) at the University of Washington, supported by the NSF GRFP. Broadly speaking, my interests are in differential geometry; my prior research has been in symplectic geometry and the spectral theory of operators.

Most recently, I worked with [Dr. Lino Amorim](https://www.math.ksu.edu/~lamorim/) on a project studying an analogue to Chen-Ruan cohomology on dihedral twisted sectors. Prior to this, I participated in the 2022 REU in Mathematical Analysis at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga under [Dr. Roger Nichols](https://sites.google.com/mocs.utc.edu/rogernicholshomepage/home), where my cohort studied the weak convergence of the spectral shift operator between two resolvent-comparable Schr√∂dinger operators.
