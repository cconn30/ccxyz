I am a fourth-year undergraduate student in mathematics at Kansas State University. Broadly speaking, my interests lie in differential geometry and analysis; more specifically my research has been in symplectic geometry and the spectral theory of operators.

I am currently working with [Dr. Lino Amorim](https://www.math.ksu.edu/~lamorim/) on a project studying an analogue to stringy cohomology on dihedral twisted sectors. My prior work was at the 2022 REU in Mathematical Analysis at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga under [Dr. Roger Nichols](https://sites.google.com/mocs.utc.edu/rogernicholshomepage/home), where my cohort studied the weak convergence of the spectral shift operator between two resolvent-comparable Schr√∂dinger operators.
