## Commentary

Amongst all genres that I listen to, I am the most interested in techno, including its history and evolution as it spread from its origin in Detroit, over to Germany, Belgium, the UK, and the Netherlands, and how these influences abroad meshed with the sound back in the US (and other regions in Eurasia and the world). I spend a lot of my time searching for and collecting techno (both in digital and physical form), and every once in a while I play around with a controller for fun.


## Mixes

[Soundcloud upload](https://soundcloud.com/cconn30/back-on-the-decks-techno-112225) -- An "I've neglected my controller since moving to Seattle" improv set, excited to get tighter mixes again.
