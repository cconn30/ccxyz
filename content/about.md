I graduated from high school in Greater Houston, TX, and I received my B.S. in Mathematics from Kansas State University in Manhattan, KS. Since September 2024, I have been a Ph.D. student at the University of Washington in Seattle, WA. I intend to work in research, ideally in the academic realm, following the completion of my degree.

External to academia, my hobbies include (but are not limited to):

- swimming (except backstroke)
- road-tripping/travelling
- rock climbing and hiking
- road biking
- listening to five new songs a day
- live music
- cooking interesting food
- making and solving puzzles
- attempting to make a website
- some feasible combination of the above.
