I graduated from high school in Greater Houston, TX, and I received my B.S. in Mathematics from Kansas State University in Manhattan, KS. Since September 2024, I have been a Ph.D. student at the University of Washington in Seattle, WA. I intend to work in research following the completion of my degree.

During my undergrad, I worked with [Dr. Lino Amorim](https://www.math.ksu.edu/~lamorim/) on a project studying an analogue to Chen-Ruan cohomology on dihedral twisted sectors. Prior to this, I participated in the 2022 REU in Mathematical Analysis at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga under [Dr. Roger Nichols](https://sites.google.com/mocs.utc.edu/rogernicholshomepage/home), where my cohort studied the weak convergence of the spectral shift operator between two resolvent-comparable Schrödinger operators.

External to academia, my hobbies include (but are not limited to):

- swimming (except backstroke)
- road-tripping/travelling
- rock climbing and hiking
- road biking
- skiing
- music (particularly techno)
- live music
- cooking interesting food
- making and solving puzzles
- attempting to make a website
- some nonempty intersection of the above.
