I graduated from high school in greater Houston, TX, and I am currently a senior at Kansas State University in Manhattan, KS. I intend to pursue graduate studies in mathematics following graduation, and subsequently work in research, ideally in the academic realm.

External to academia, my hobbies include (but are not limited to):

- swimming (except backstroke)
- road-tripping/travelling
- rock climbing
- road biking
- listening to five new songs a day
- making and solving puzzles
- attempting to make a website
- some feasible combination of the above.
