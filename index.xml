I spend a lot of my time searching for and collecting techno (both in digital and physical form), and every once in a while I play around with a controller for fun.</description>

      <description>I graduated from high school in Greater Houston, TX, and I received my B.S. in Mathematics from Kansas State University in Manhattan, KS. Since September 2024, I have been a Ph.D. student at the University of Washington in Seattle, WA. I intend to work in research following the completion of my degree.
During my undergrad, I worked with Dr. Lino Amorim on a project studying an analogue to Chen-Ruan cohomology on dihedral twisted sectors.</description>
