      <description>I graduated from high school in greater Houston, TX, and I am currently a senior at Kansas State University in Manhattan, KS. I intend to pursue graduate studies in mathematics following graduation, and subsequently work in research, ideally in the academic realm.
External to academia, my hobbies include (but are not limited to):
swimming (except backstroke) road-tripping/travelling rock climbing road biking listening to five new songs a day making and solving puzzles attempting to make a website some feasible combination of the above.</description>
