      <description>I graduated from high school in Greater Houston, TX, and I received my B.S. in Mathematics from Kansas State University in Manhattan, KS. Since September 2024, I have been a Ph.D. student at the University of Washington in Seattle, WA. I intend to work in research, ideally in the academic realm, following the completion of my degree.
External to academia, my hobbies include (but are not limited to):
swimming (except backstroke) road-tripping/travelling rock climbing and hiking road biking listening to five new songs a day live music cooking interesting food making and solving puzzles attempting to make a website some feasible combination of the above.</description>
