      <description>Amongst all genres that I listen to, I am the most interested in techno, including its history and evolution as it spread from its origin in Detroit, over to Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands, and back to the US and other regions in Europe and the world. I spend a lot of my time searching for and collecting techno (both in digital and physical form), and every once in a while I play around with a controller for fun.</description>
